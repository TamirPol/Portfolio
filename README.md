A clean, animation‑forward **portfolio website** that showcases my **projects, experience, skills, and contact** info.  
The goal is clarity + tasteful motion: quick to read, easy to navigate, and pleasant to interact with.

---

## What this site includes

- **Home** — bold hero with subtle GSAP motion to set the tone.
- **About / Experience** — two‑tab panel that snaps instantly between a short bio and selected roles/impact.
- **Projects** — horizontal card carousel with tuned wheel speed, no auto‑lock (you can stop anywhere), and branded placeholders where final images are pending.
- **Skills** — compact grid of tools and languages I actually use.
- **Contact** — lightweight form (wired for EmailJS) plus direct links.

> **Status:** Work in progress. A small first‑visit notice lets you know a few visuals are still being polished.

## Why it feels good to use

- **Focused micro‑interactions** (no gimmicks): quick fades, modest movement, predictable timing.
- **Readable at a glance**: project cards highlight the “what/impact/stack” rather than walls of text.
- **Keyboard‑friendly & accessible**: logical headings, dialog roles, visible focus, Esc/Tab support on the popup.

---

## Motion & UX details

- **GSAP hero** with character‑level entrance and slight drift for depth.
- **Tab switch animation** for About ↔ Experience (fast, unobtrusive).
- **Projects carousel** with calibrated inertia and distance so each card centers naturally without auto‑snapping.
- **First‑visit popup** _(“Website in progress”)_ implemented as a real dialog with focus trapping.

---

## Tech & Tools

- **HTML5 • CSS3 • JavaScript (ES6)**
- **GSAP 3** (+ **ScrollTrigger**) via CDN
- **EmailJS** for the contact form (IDs/tokens supplied privately)

---

## Content structure

```
Home
About / Experience
Projects
Skills
Contact
```

Each section is intentionally brief and visual—links to repos/demos live on the cards themselves.

---

## Notes

- Project thumbnails use a **custom “Image Coming Soon”** placeholder until final media is uploaded.
- Copy is tuned for recruiters and collaborators: impact first, tech second, fluff never.
